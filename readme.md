I am Blake (Kurozume, whatever); a fan of anime currently learning JAVA development and the discord API. I am still working on improving my coding skills as I build these bots, so if there are a few bugs; report them on the support server or message me directly on discord: Blake#4452<br /> <a href="https://discordapp.com/channels/@me"><em>Open Discord</em></a><br />
Any other questions then also DM me with those as well and i'll be willing to answer if i'm available</p>
